## 📌 Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive timeline showcasing the evolution of data science and data-related careers over the decades. The goal of this mini-project is to illustrate key milestones in the evolution of data-relates roles within Information Technology (IT) -from the first database administrators to modern roles like MLOps and IA Governance. The time will highlight:
- Key milestones and technological breakthroughs that have shaped the field of data management, analysis, and processing.
- The pioneers and leading figures whose innovations and contributions have driven the advancement of data technolgies.
- The emergence and transformatioin of careers related to data , from early database management roles to modern data science and IA positions.
- The integration of statistical data and visual elements to illustrater trends in data volume, technological adoption, and workforce growth.
- To create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard (using tool such as Tableau) that enables users to explore the history and future direction of data science.

This project aims to demostrat my ability to research, synthesize complex historical and technical information , and present it effectively through data visualization techniques, thereby showcasing skills critical for a data analyst role.
