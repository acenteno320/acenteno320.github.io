## Evolution of Data Roles Timeline

This project presents an interactive timeline that illustrates the evolution of key data-related job roles from the 1950s to the present day. It highlights how technological advances, new tools, and industry needs have shaped the roles and skills required in the data field over the decades.

**Key elements included:**
- Typical job roles by decade (e.g., statisticians, database administrators, data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers).
- Emerging technologies and tools associated with each era.
- Relevant skills that became critical as the field evolved.
- Insights into future trends and projected roles.

This timeline complements my *Pioneers in Data Evolution* project by connecting historical inventions and milestones with the actual career paths and job opportunities that have emerged as a result.
