## Highlights by Century

**17th to 18th Century (1600s–1700s):**  
Early foundations in statistical analysis and demographic data collection, including mortality studies and actuarial tables.

**19th Century (1800s):**  
Development of formal statistics, social statistics, and data visualization techniques applied to public health and society.

**Early 20th Century (1900–1950):**  
Establishment of modern statistical theory, invention of the computing machine concept, and initial advances in computer architecture and programming.

**Late 20th Century (1950–1999):**  
Creation of relational databases, structured query languages (SQL), data warehousing, and the rise of data mining methods.

**21st Century (2000–2025):**  
Explosion of big data technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, advanced interactive data visualization tools, and a growing focus on data privacy and ethics.

By examining this data, users can gain a clearer understanding of how the field of data has developed over nearly four centuries, from early statistical analysis to modern big data and artificial intelligence innovations.

## Pioneers and Milestones in Data History (1640–2025)

### 1640–1899: Foundations of Data and Statistics
Notable figures from this era include:**

- **John Graunt (1620–1674):** Early demographic data analysis; analyzed mortality records.
- **Edmund Halley (1656–1742):** Developed actuarial tables for risk and life expectancy.
- **Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874):** Applied statistics to social sciences; introduced the “average man” concept.
- **Florence Nightingale (1820–1910):** Used data visualization to improve public health.

### 1900–1950: Statistical Theory and Early Computing
Notable figures from this era include:

- **Francis Galton (1822–1911):** Correlation and regression concepts.
- **Karl Pearson (1857–1936):** Mathematical foundations of statistics.
- **Alan Turing (1912–1954):** Conceptualized computing machines (Turing machine).
- **John von Neumann (1903–1957):** Developed the computer architecture model.
- **Claude Shannon (1916–2001):** Created information theory.
- **Grace Hopper (1906–1992):** Developed early compilers and programming languages.

### 1950–1999: Relational Databases and Data Mining
Notable figures from this era include:

- **Edgar F. Codd (1923–2003):** Proposed the relational database model (1970).
- Development of SQL and data warehouses.
- Growth of data mining techniques and predictive modeling.

### 2000–2025: Big Data, AI, and Data Ethics
Notable figures from this era include:

- Emergence of Big Data platforms (Hadoop, Spark).
- Advancement in machine learning and AI algorithms.
- Popularization of interactive visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI).
- Focus on data privacy and ethical standards (GDPR, etc.).
